  "meal_plan": "After reviewing the provided patient data, there is a conflict between the pregnancy status and the stated dietary goal of losing weight. In a pregnant patient, intentional weight loss is generally not recommended due to potential risks to maternal and fetal health. Therefore, we need clarification on whether the goal is to maintain a healthy pregnancy nutritional plan with appropriate gestational weight gain or if the patient intends to pursue weight loss post-pregnancy. Please provide additional guidance or confirm the primary dietary goal before a safe and effective meal plan can be generated.",
  "nutritional_info": "Insufficient information due to conflicting goals: the patient is pregnant (which typically requires adequate nutrient intake for maternal and fetal health) but also has a weight loss goal. Nutritional needs for a pregnant individual with hypertension and CKD must focus on controlled protein, low sodium, and balanced micronutrients rather than caloric restriction for weight loss. Clarification is needed to proceed with accurate DRI-based calculations.",
  "shopping_list": "Unable to generate a shopping list until the diet plan is clarified. A complete list will include items compatible with a Mexican cuisine-inspired, low-sodium, kidney-friendly, and lactose-free meal pattern that avoids peanuts and spinach. Please clarify the dietary goal to proceed.",
  "recipes": "Recipes will be tailored to the finalized meal plan. For example, Mexican-inspired dishes that are quick to prepare (15-30 minutes) and meet the requirements for low sodium and lactose-free ingredients will be provided. Additionally, recipes will avoid spinach and peanuts. However, without clarity on whether to focus on pregnancy nutritional adequacy or weight loss, detailed recipes cannot be provided at this time."
